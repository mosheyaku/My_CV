Developed a personal portfolio website using the Django framework in
Python, incorporating Python, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
The website focuses on presenting my resume in a visually appealing and
user-friendly design, featuring interactive elements to enhance the overall
browsing experience.

This is the main view of the site:
